/**
 * Prices a market from several bookmakers' prices without ever offering more than the market as a whole.
 *
 * 1. Each bookmaker's prices are turned into probabilities and scaled to sum to 1, removing that bookmaker's margin.
 * 2. The median probability per outcome is taken, so a single outlying bookmaker cannot move the price.
 * 3. The medians are rescaled to sum to 1, our margin is applied, and each price is rounded down to 2 decimals.
 *
 * Picking the best price across bookmakers instead can produce a book whose prices sum to under 100%, which
 * guarantees a loss to anyone backing every outcome.
